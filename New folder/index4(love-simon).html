              <blockquote>
                <p>'Simon vs. the Homo sapiens Agenda' by Becky Albertalli is a book about a closeted homosexual high school boy named Simon Spier. He has fallen in love with a mysterious 'Blue' that he sent emails to. One day, Simon was using the school library computer to send an email to Blue and when he was done he turned off the computer without logging off his account. After he left another student, Martin, turned on the computer and found out about Simon's emails. Simon then had to help Martin out by trying to make his best friend Abby fall in love with him. If he didn't do what he was told, Martin would leak the emails to Tumblr and the whole school would find out that Simon was gay. This is obviously blackmail.</p>
                <p>I would highly recommend this book to anyone over the age of 13 as it deals with a worldwide spoken topic and uses strong language. It is a comedic, drama, romance novel. If you're also interested, a film about the book came out (pun intended) last May by the name of Love, Simon.</p>
