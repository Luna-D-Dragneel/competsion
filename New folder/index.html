          <blockquote>
              <p class="lead"> This website is for the people who love to read and want to find out about different books and what they are about it</p>
              <p class="lead"> This is a something that has a part of my heart and soul in to it. I and my friend did everything we could have done for this website to work. We asked our friend to send us some of their reviews to help get it started. We built it from the ground up, and we love it. We both love books so we decided to create and do a blog on books that we and our other friend have read. </p>
              <p class="lead"> We are not experts at this but we wanted to try.You will find this related to books and the geeky world. You can find reviews of any books and genre of your liking.</p>
              <p class="lead"> We were always fascinated about the internet and YouTube and a competition was a great opportunity to put a dream into a reality. We mixed a little bit of geekiness together with some reading and coding and there you go, THIS BLOG that you are reading! Hope you like it.</p>
